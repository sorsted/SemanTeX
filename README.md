SemanTeX -- semantic, keyval-based mathematics
--------------------------------------

The SemanTeX package for LaTeX delivers a more semantic,
systematized way of writing mathematics, compared to the
classical math syntax in LaTeX. The system uses keyval
syntax, and the user can define their own keys and
customize the system down to the last detail. At the same
time, care has been taken to make the syntax as simple,
natural, practical, and lightweight as possible.

Furthermore, the package has a companion package,
called stripsemantex, which allows you to completely strip
your documents of SemanTeX markup to prepare them e.g. for publication.

The package is still in beta, but is considered feature-complete
and more or less stable, so using it at this point should be safe.
Still, suggestions, ideas, and bug reports are more than welcome!
